# Perceptron from Scratch (Binary Classification)

This project contains a minimal yet complete implementation of the **Perceptron algorithm** — one of the earliest and simplest types of artificial neural networks — built from scratch using **NumPy**.

The model is applied to a binary classification task using the **Iris dataset**, and visualized using `matplotlib`.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Iris Dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`
- Binary classification: **Setosa (0)** vs **Versicolor (1)**
- Using only two features: **Sepal Length** and **Petal Length**

## Notes

.Uses stochastic updates (one sample at a time)

.No loss function in the traditional sense — updates are based on sign errors

.Great starting point for understanding neural networks & linear classifiers
