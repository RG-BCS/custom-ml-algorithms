# Perceptron from Scratch

This project implements a binary Perceptron classifier from scratch using NumPy. It applies the model to a subset of the Iris dataset and visualizes the decision boundary and training error.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Manual implementation (no scikit-learn models used)
- Uses only NumPy and Matplotlib
- Decision boundary and error plot visualization
- Self-contained utility for plotting regions

## Demo

Use the included notebook or script to:

- Train the Perceptron on Setosa vs Versicolor (Iris dataset)
- Visualize the classification boundary
- Plot the number of misclassifications over time
