# Majority Vote Classifier

A custom ensemble learning implementation that combines multiple base classifiers using majority voting. Supports both **class label** and **probability-based** voting strategies, fully compatible with the `scikit-learn` API, including pipelines and `GridSearchCV`.

## How to Run

### Option 1: Run Demo Script

```bash
# Step 1: Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 2: Run the demo script
python demo_script.py
```

### Option 2: Use Jupyter Notebook

```bash
# Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook demo.ipynb

The notebook contains:

-Cross-validation scores
-ROC & Precision-Recall curves
-Decision boundary plots

```

## Requirements

```bash
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
```

## Background

Ensemble methods combine the predictions of multiple models to produce better generalization.
This project implements a custom majority voting ensemble that mimics the functionality of VotingClassifier, but allows deeper customization and inspection.

---

# Use Cases
```bash
-Experimenting with ensemble methods in custom pipelines
-Teaching or learning ML ensembling concepts
-Extending voting behavior for more complex tasks (e.g., time-series or NLP classifiers)
```
