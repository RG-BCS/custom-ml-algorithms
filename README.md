# custom-ml-algorithms

A curated collection of **classic machine learning algorithms**, all implemented from scratch using **Python and NumPy** â€” without relying on high-level ML libraries like scikit-learn.

This repo focuses on building a deep understanding of the **inner mechanics** of machine learning models, optimization, and evaluation techniques.  
Itâ€™s ideal for learning, teaching, interviews, and showcasing applied ML knowledge.

## Example Use

```python
from linear_models.logistic_regression import LogisticRegression

model = LogisticRegression(learning_rate=0.1, max_iter=1000, regularization="l2")
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
